# robo_carol_instrument
The Instrument part of the Robotic Caroler project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need Arduino IDE to compile and deploy this program

### Installing

It's a fairly simple Arduino project. So just clone the project and open it in the Arduino IDE. No additional libraries required. Once installed, you can customize the program. See the comments.

This program outputs some state info to the Serial port (baud rate: 115200). It is also possible to turn off the Serial output by commenting out (or removing) the `#define TEST` preprocessor command. 

## Deployment

Deploy it on any arduino compatible board. It is tested on Arduino Uno.
